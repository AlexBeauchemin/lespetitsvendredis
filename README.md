# Les petits vendredis

Converted a old Wordpress blog I made for my mom ages ago to a static site.
Converted to simple html pages with CSS so it can be served via CDN and cost nothing to host.
Really simple and basic. Removed any CMS functionality as nothing is planned to be added.

Run via `bun serve.ts`
